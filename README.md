## [Ten questions to ask when analyzing registration data](http://www.unhcr.org/47f0a6db2.pdf)

Determine the percentage of the population by sex, age group, andother factors, and consider:
* Is it the same as the local population? Does it coincide with the datafrom the country of origin? 
* Is there  a higher-than-average  percentage  of  women?  Children?Older persons? Persons with disabilities? 
* If one group, such as adult men or young children, seems under- orover-represented, find out why. 
* Has the registration team been trained on how to identify and reg-ister groups with specific needs and persons at heightenedrisk? 
* Have groups withspecific needs been registered in detail in coordi-nationwith community services? If not, why not and how will thisbe done? 
* Have those responsible for registration understood the criteria forunaccompanied and separated children? 
* Does the populationprofile indicate potential protection risks forany particular group? 
* Who might beat heightened risk? Why?What immediate action isbeing taken toprotect these persons?Has a confidential, individualcase-management system been established? 
* Do you have data on the leadership structure? Are any groups,espe-ciallyminorities, youth and women, not represented? If so, why? 
* How does the socio-economic status and ethnic, linguistic and reli-giouscomposition of the refugee population compare with that ofthe local host population?
