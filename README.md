# proGres-analysis

Script for advanced statistical analysis of Refugee Registration database & assistance tracking

* Basic demographic variables

* Specific needs

* Case management events

* Individual assistance events

## Output

The package is designed to work on a standard query in the registration database that aggregates key variables at houshold levels

Many reports are already produced from proGres but they mostly look at univariate analysis, i.e each variable within the dataset is displayed one by one. The present document is an attempt to explore various dimensions interact between each others. 


## Data description

The information recorded in the Refugee Registration Database covers not only basic demographic characteristics but also identification of Specific Needs and recording of Events such as Resettlement Acceptation or Voluntary Departure. UNHCR Registration system is described in the [Handbook for Registration](http://www.unhcr.org/4a278ea1d.pdf) and particularly in the [annex 7](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzY6xxaS0lO3TXYwaUpzWi1zTW8/view) that displays the Standard Categories and Codes.

The used dataset correspond to the analysis of all cases (i.e. group of individuals registered together that often corresponds to a family unit or household) whose status is **active** within the database. Some of the indivdual information is kept for the head of household.

### Specific need within household

The [Specific Needs Codes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B95I9qaU50xgYWNpSWxXNGhTaUk/view) provide a standardized and exhaustive list of an individualâ€™s particular characteristics, background, or risks that may provoke protection exigencies. UNHCR used the  [Heightened Risk Identification Tool](http://www.refworld.org/docid/4c46c6860.html) to identify specific needs.

The 10 Categories below are then subdivided in finer categories.

## Key Research questions for UNHCR Registration data

when analyzing registration data, based on the percentage of the population by sex, age group, and other factors, the following [10 questions](http://www.unhcr.org/47f0a6db2.pdf) can be used:

* Is it the same as the local population? Does it coincide with the data from the country of origin? 

* Is there  a higher-than-average  percentage  of  women?  Children? Older persons? Persons with disabilities? 

* If one group, such as adult men or young children, seems under- or over-represented, find out why. 

* Has the registration team been trained on how to identify and register groups with specific needs and persons at heightened risk? 

* Have groups with specific needs been registered in detail in coordination with community services? If not, why not and how will this be done?

* Have those responsible for registration understood the criteria for unaccompanied and separated children? 

* Does the population profile indicate potential protection risks for any particular group? 

* Who might be at heightened risk? Why? What immediate action isbeing taken to protect these persons? Has a confidential, individual case-management system been established? 

* Do you have data on the leadership structure? Are any groups,especially minorities, youth and women, not represented? If so, why? 

* How does the socio-economic status and ethnic, linguistic and religious composition of the refugee population compare with that of the local host population?
