## [Ten questions to ask when analyzing registration data](http://www.unhcr.org/47f0a6db2.pdf)

Determine the percentage of the population by sex, age group, andother factors, and consider:
* Is it the same as the local population? Does it coincide with the data from the country of origin? 

* Is there  a higher-than-average  percentage  of  women?  Children? Older persons? Persons with disabilities? 

* If one group, such as adult men or young children, seems under- orover-represented, find out why. 

* Has the registration team been trained on how to identify and register groups with specific needs and persons at heightenedrisk? 

* Have groups with specific needs been registered in detail in coordination with community services? If not, why not and how will this be done?

* Have those responsible for registration understood the criteria for unaccompanied and separated children? 

* Does the population profile indicate potential protection risks for any particular group? 

* Who might beat heightened risk? Why? What immediate action isbeing taken toprotect these persons? Has a confidential, individual case-management system been established? 

* Do you have data on the leadership structure? Are any groups,especially minorities, youth and women, not represented? If so, why? 

* How does the socio-economic status and ethnic, linguistic and religious composition of the refugee population compare with that of the local host population?
