```{r , echo=FALSE}

## Load the preprocessed dataset 
data <- read.csv("data/progrescase2.csv")

summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
