# Chapter 4: Population Segmentation

 * Since the 70's, Social scientist have developed __data exploratory__ techniques that allow to discover statistical segments among a specific population. Those techniques are commonly used in __marketing studies__.

 * To do that, Clustering analysis aims to group a set of records in such a way that records in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. [Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_correspondence_analysis) together with [Hierarchical Classification on Principle Components](http://factominer.free.fr/classical-methods/hierarchical-clustering-on-principal-components.html) can be used to process together multiple categorical data  in order to detect and represent the __underlying structures__ in a data set. 

 * This aims at generating induction rather than testing an hypothesis according to model. The resulting segments should be interpreted as broad categories (rather than a criteria-based classification) that can then help informing programme design and subsequent __theories of change__ for each segments.
